# ensemble

**ensemble** is a tiny JS library, which can be used as a starting point to create beautiful components.

**ensemble** is the foundation for **ensemble Modal**, **ensemble Lightbox** and **ensemble SocialShare**.

It is a JavaScript module with 5 main classes: **base** class, **Compo** wrap around node `Element` \[DOM\], **Data** wrap around `ensemble.Compo` element, **Event** wrap around `Event` \[DOM\], **Snap** wrap around `DocumentFragment` \[DOM\].

**ensemble** is not gluey, it does not contain anykind of data controller.

You can use **ensemble** also with other libraries (example in the *misc* folder).
