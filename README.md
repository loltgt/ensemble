# ensemble

**ensemble** is a tiny JS library, which can be used as a starting point to create beautiful components.

**ensemble** is the foundation for **ensemble Modal**, **ensemble Lightbox** and **ensemble SocialShare**.

It is a JavaScript module with 5 main classes:
* **Compo** wrap around node `Element` [DOM]
* **Data** wrap around `Compo` element
* **Event** wrap around `Event` [DOM]
* **Snap** wrap around `DocumentFragment` [DOM]
* **base** class

**ensemble** is not gluey, it does not contain anykind of superstructure.

You can use **ensemble** also with other libraries (example in the *misc* folder).


## Install

Using npm:
```shell
npm install --save-dev github:loltgt/ensemble
```
